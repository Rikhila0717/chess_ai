## Description

I implemented a new chess agent which implements the minimax algorithm. Since minimax follows a recursive approach, there will be a case where the original state might change. So, I have created copy classes of the Board, Square, Piece and all the game pieces. In the minimax algorithm, all the steps are executed on the copy of the board.

## How to run this code

Clone the repository into the local system. Directly run the main.py file. It's set with the random player as the white player and the minimax player as the black player.
